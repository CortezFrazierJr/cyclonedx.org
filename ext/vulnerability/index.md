# Extension: Vulnerability

The Vulnerability extension provides the ability to represent component vulnerabilities in a BOM.
This extension relies on a components `bom-ref` to associate the component to vulnerability elements. The only 
requirement for bom-ref is that it is unique within the BOM. The Package URL (PURL) is an ideal choice for 
bom-ref as it will be both unique and readable. If PURL is not an option or not all components represented in 
the BOM contain a PURL, then UUID is recommended.

Vulnerabilities may be added to the component nodes or included at the end of the bom node. Either is valid.

**Credit**: This schema was developed and contributed by [Sonatype](https://www.sonatype.com) in collaboration with CycloneDX.

| Version | Namespace |
| ------- | --------- |
| 1.0 | http://cyclonedx.org/schema/ext/vulnerability/1.0 |

<div class="callout callout--warning">
This schema extension is applicable to CycloneDX v1.3 and lower. It has been incorporated (with major changes) into
CycloneDX v1.4 and higher.

### Example Usage (Component Node)

In this example, the vulnerabilities are grouped with the components they reference.
